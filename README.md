# Machine Translation

Translating a text from One Language To Another.

## Methods Used

1. Encoder - Decoder Architecture

2. Training and Inference Mode of Decoder

# Technologies Used
```
1. LSTM

2. Sequence To Sequence Model(Encoder-Decoder)

3. Data Mining

```

## Usage

It can be used as a translator where you will be getting the result in a new language.

## Improvement

We can improve the model by improving the dataset. Training with more epochs with the improved daatset.
